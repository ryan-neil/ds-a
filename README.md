<h1 align="left">Data Structures and Algorithms</h1>

The goal of this document is to provide a quick reference guide for the main concepts of Data Structures and Algorithms. There will also be some examples that are, hopefully, simple to understand.

For this reference guide all example code will be written in **JavaScript**.
