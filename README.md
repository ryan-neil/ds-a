## 1. Big O Notation

__Big O Notation__ allows us to have a numeric representation of the performance of code. It allows us to talk formally about how the runtime of an algorithm grows as the input grows.

Well, why does this matter?

  * It's important to have a precise vocabulary to talk about how performant our code is
  * Useful for discussing trade-offs between different approaches
  * When your code slows down or crashes, identifying parts of the code that are inefficient can help us find pain points in our applications
  * It's important for interviews!

Big O is focused on the _big_ picture.

**[‚¨Ü Top](#üìì-Table-of-Contents)**

### Timing our code

Suppose we want to write a function that calculates the sum of all numbers from 1 up to (and including) some number _n_. Let's look at two examples of some code:

Method 1: Big O = __O(n)__ (linear)
```js
function addUpTo(n) {
  let total = 0;
  for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    total += i;
  }
  return total;
}

// test our algorithm
let t1 = performance.now();
addUpTo(1_000_000_000); // -> 500_000_000_067_109_000
let t2 = performance.now();
console.log(`Time Elapsed: ${(t2 - t1) / 1000} seconds.`);
// -> Time Elapsed: 1.16610 seconds.
```

Method 2: Big O = __O(1)__ (constant)
```js
function addUpTo(n) {
  return n * (n + 1) / 2;
}

// test our algorithm
let time1 = performance.now();
addUpTo(1_000_000_000); // -> 500_000_000_067_109_000
let time2 = performance.now();
console.log(`Time Elapsed: ${(time2 - time1) / 1000} seconds.`);
// -> Time Elapsed: 0.00001 seconds.
```

You'll notice our second method is much faster (relative) than method 1. But this is not the most efficient way of tracking whether one code block is faster or better than another code block.

**[‚¨Ü Top](#üìì-Table-of-Contents)**

### The problem with time

  * Different machines will record different times
  * The same machine will record different times
  * For fast algorithms, speed measurements may not be precise enough

So how do we walk through our code and actually talk in general terms about which code is better without having to set up a new file and time it?

That's where Big O Notation comes in!

#### Counting operations not seconds:

Rather than counting _seconds_, which are so variable... Let's count the _number_ of simple operations the computer has to perform. This will remain constant no matter what computer we're on.

```js
function addUpTo(n) {
  return n * ( n + 1 ) / 2;
}
```
In the example above, we have 3 __operations__ going on (1 multiplication, 1 addition, and 1 division). Regardless if our number (`n`) is 1 or 1 billion there will always only be 3 __operations__. 

This is __O(1)__ (constant) which is very efficient.

Let's compare that to our other example from above:
```js
function addUpTo(n) {
  let total = 0;
  for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    total += i;
  }
  return total;
}
```
In this example, since we're looping, where we have `total += i` the addition is not just 1 addition operation, it's `n` number of operations. And same goes for the rest of the operators in this method, they will all run `n` number of times. 

This is __O(n)__ (linear) which is extremely inefficient.

Depending on what we count, the number of operations can be as low as _2n_ or as high as _5n + 2_. But regardless of the exact number, the number of operations grows roughly _proportionally_ with _n_.

**[‚¨Ü Top](#üìì-Table-of-Contents)**

### Big O logic

Warning! Technically definition:

We say that an algorithm is __O(f(n))__ if the number of simple operations the computer has to do is eventually less than a constant times __f(n)__, as __n__ increases. Huh...

Basically, what it's doing is describing the relationship between the input (f(n)) and the output or runtime (n, n¬≤, 1).

Let's look as some options below:

##### `f(n)`: a function with an input of 'n'
##### `f(n) = n`: a function with an input of 'n' and an output of 'n'

Options:
  * f(n) could be __linear__ (f(n) = n)
  * f(n) could be __quadratic__ (f(n) = n¬≤)
  * f(n) could be __constant__ (f(n) = 1)
  * f(n) could be something entirely different

#### Linear:

__O(n)__

As n scales, the input (`f(n)`) and the runtime (`n`) scales as well.

#### Quadratic:

__O(n¬≤)__

As `n` scales, the runtime (`n¬≤`) squares (square event).

It's important to note that an `O(n)` operation inside of an `O(n)` operation gives us `O(n * n)` or `O(n¬≤)`.

#### Constant:

__O(1)__

As `n` scales, it doesn't really have an impact because runtime is always constant, which we simplify down to `1`.

#### Simplifying Big O:

Constants don't matter.
```
O(2O) -> O(n)
O(500) -> O(1)
O(13n¬≤) -> O(n¬≤)
```

Smaller terms don't matter.
```
O(n + 10) -> O(n)
O(1000n + 50) -> O(n)
O(n¬≤ + 5n + 8) -> O(n¬≤)
```

#### Shorthands:

> Note: these rules won't always work, but are a helpful starting point.

1. Arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) are constant
2. Variable assignment is constant, (x = 1) and (x = 1000) are roughly the same
3. Accessing elements in an array (by index) or object (by key) is constant
4. In a loop, the complexity is the length of the loop times the complexity of whatever happens inside of the loop

**[‚¨Ü Top](#üìì-Table-of-Contents)**

### Space complexity

So far, we've been focusing on __time complexity__: 
  * How can we analyze the __runtime__ of an algorithm as the size of the inputs increase?

We can also use Big O Notation to analyze __space complexity__: 
  * How much additional memory do we need to allocate in order to run the code in our algorithm?

> Note: when we talk about space complexity, technically we'll be talking about auxiliary space complexity

__Auxiliary Space__: is the temporary space allocated by your algorithm to solve the problem, with respect to input size.

__Space Complexity__: is the total space used by your algorithm to solve the problem, with respect to input size. Note that the Space Complexity includes input size.

An example between the two would be:

If we compare Quicksort and Mergesort, they both have a space complexity of O(n) and run at O(n log n) time, but Mergesort requires Auxiliary space of O(n) while Quicksort requires Auxiliary space of O(1).

#### Rules of thumb:

  * Most primitives (booleans, numbers, undefined, null) are constant space
  * Strings require O(n) space (where n is the string length)
  * Reference types are generally O(n), where n is the length (for arrays) or the number of keys (for objects)

Let's look at an example:
```js
const sum = (arr) => {
  let total = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    total += arr[i];
  }
  return total;
};
sum([ 2, 6, 4, 9 ]); // -> 21
```

In the example above, no matter what the array length is, we have one variable called `total` (one number). And then we're looping through, but remember we're not concerned about the _time_, we also have a second declaration inside the for loop (`let i = 0`) which is another number. But that's it for _space_.

So again no matter what the size of the array is (n), or in our case `arr`, as it grows it won't have an impact on the space that's taken up because we only have 2 variables (`total` and `i`). We aren't adding new variables based on the length, we're adding to the `total` variable, but not making a new one.

So this means we have _constant_ space (O(1) space!).

Let's have a look at another example:
```js
const double = (arr) => {
  let newArr = [];
  for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    newArr.push(arr[i] * 2);
  }
  return newArr;
};
double([ 2, 6, 4, 9 ]); // -> [ 4, 12, 8, 18 ]
```

So how does this effect the space complexity of this algorithm? So as the array (`arr`) length grows, our `newArr` variable is directly proportionate to the length of the input. So if the `arr` is 10 items, we're storing 10 items in `newArr`.

So the space taken up is directly proportionate to `n` and to the input array. So for space complexity we would have __O(n)__.

**[‚¨Ü Top](#üìì-Table-of-Contents)**

### Logarithms

So far, we've encountered some of the most common complexities: __O(1)__, __O(n)__, __O(n¬≤)__. Sometimes Big O expressions invilve more complex mathematical expressions. One that appears more often than we might like is the __logarithm__.

#### What's a logarithm?

To put simply, a __logarithm__ is the inverse of exponentiation. So, just like _division_ and _multiplication_ are a pair, _logarithms_ and _exponents_ are a pair.

log<sub>2</sub>(8) -> 2<sup>3</sup> = 8
<br>
log<sub>2</sub>(_value_) = _exponent_ -> 2<sup>_exponent_</sup> = _value_

What we're concerned about is the _Big_ picture so we're just going to omit the 2. We'll just say log:

log == log<sub>2</sub>

It doesn't really matter at the end of the day, because if we're comparing the graph of a constant time and a quadratic time and log(n) time, it doesn't really matter if it's log base 2, log base 10. All we care about is the general _trend_.

#### Rule of thumb:

The logarithm of a number roughly measures the number of times you can divide that number by 2 __before you get a value that's less than or equal to one__.

#### Example 1: Find the log of 8

```
8 / 2 = 4 -> still > 1. 
4 / 2 = 2 -> still > 1. 
2 / 2 = 1 -> Finally we get <= 1.

log(8) = 3 -> Since we had to divide 3 times.
```

#### Example 2: Find the log of 25

```
25     / 2 = 12.5     -> still > 1.
12.5   / 2 = 6.25     -> still > 1.
6.25   / 2 = 3.125    -> still > 1.
3.125  / 2 = 1.5625   -> still > 1.
1.5625 / 2 = 0.78125  -> Finally we get <= 1.

log(25) = ~ 4.64 -> Since we had to divide somewhere between 4 and 5 times.
```

#### Logarithm Complexity

In example 2 from above, there's no way of dividing 2 evenly into 25 but this isn't that important. We don't really care whether or not the number is divisible by 2.

What we do care about is the Logarithm Complexity. Logarithm time complexity is amazing! If we have an algorithm with O(log n) this is fantastic.

#### Why is this important?

  * Certain searching algorithms have logarithmic time complexity.
  * Efficient sorting algorithms involve logarithms.
  * Recursion sometimes involves logarithmic space complexity.

## 2. Analyzing Performance of Arrays and Objects

#### Objectives:

  * Understand how objects and arrays work, through the lens of Big O
  * Explain why adding elements to the beginning of an array is costly
  * Compare and contrast the runtime for arrays and objects, as well as their built-in methods

### The Big O of objects

Example:
```js
let instructor = {
  firstName: 'Katie',
  isInstructor: true,
  favoriteNumbers: [ 1, 2, 3, 4 ]
}
```

When to use objects:
  * Objects work well when we don't need order
  * When we need fast access/insertion and removal

Insertion - __O(1)__
<br>
Removal - __O(1)__
<br>
Search - __O(N)__
<br>
Access - __O(1)__

As you can see from above, objects are VERY fast. They're constant time which is the best we can do.

#### Object methods

Now let's look at the Big O of object methods we have in JavaScript:

Object.keys - __O(N)__
<br>
Object.values - __O(N)__
<br>
Object.entries - __O(N)__
<br>
hasOwnProperty - __O(1)__

**[‚¨Ü Top](#üìì-Table-of-Contents)**

### The Big O of arrays

Example:
```js
let names = [ 'Katie', 'Ryan', 'Chinito' ];

let values = [ true, {}, [], 2, 'Hello World' ];
```

When to use objects:
  * When we need order
  * When we need fast access/insertion and removal (sort of...)

Insertion - __It depends...__
<br>
Removal - __It depends...__
<br>
Search - __O(N)__
<br>
Access - __O(1)__

Let's talk about insertion and removal. So with insertion, it really depends on where we're inserting. Say we want to add `Choncho` to the end of the `names` array from above:
```js
let names = [ 'Katie', 'Ryan', 'Chinito', 'Choncho' ];
```

This is _constant_. Where our problems come is when we want to add an item to the beginning of the array:
```js
let names = [ 'Choncho', 'Katie', 'Ryan', 'Chinito' ];
```

This has to do with the indices of the array. When we add an item to the beginning of an array we have to re-index every item in that array, so we have __O(n)__ time. Where-as when adding an item to the end we just have to index that one item, so we have __O(1)__ time.

The same logic applies for removing items from the beginning and end of arrays. So, `push()` and `pop()` will always be faster than `shift()` and `unshift()`.

#### Array methods:

Now let's look at the Big O of array methods we have in JavaScript:

push() - __O(1)__
<br>
pop() - __O(1)__
<br>
shift() - __O(N)__
<br>
unshift() - __O(N)__
<br>
concat() - __O(N)__
<br>
slice() - __O(N)__
<br>
splice() - __O(N)__
<br>
sort() - __O(N * log N)__
<br>
forEach() / map() / filter() / reduce() / etc. - __O(N)__

#### Takeaways:

1. Objects are fast at pretty much everything, but there's no order to them.
2. Arrays are great when you need an order, but still be mindful that it's better (if we can) to add and remove from the end and avoid adding and removing from the  beginning, because that starts a cascade effect, hence the terms _shift_ and _unshift_ where everything has to be re-indexed. _The same goes for adding and removing from the middle_.

## 3. Problem Solving Approach

Let's start off by defining an __algorithm__. An algorithm is essentially a __process__ or __set of steps__ to accomplish a certain task.

Almost _everything_ we do in programming involves some sort of algorithm. It is the _foundation_ for being a _successful_ problem solving _developer_.

So how do we improve at solving problems?
  1. __Devise__ a plan for solving problems
  2. __Master__ common problem solving patterns

### The approach

Let's look at some problem solving strategies that can help when we are presented with an algorithm problem:
  * Understand the problem
  * Explore concrete examples
  * Break it down
  * Solve/simplify
  * Look back and refactor

#### Step 1: Understand the problem

  1. Can I _restate_ the problem in my own words?
  2. What are the _inputs_ that go into the problem?
  3. What are the _outputs_ that should come from the solution to the problem?
  4. Can the _outputs_ be determined from the _inputs_? In other words, do I have enough information to solve the problem? 
  5. How should I _label_ the important pieces of _data_ that are a part of the problem?

#### Step 1: Example:
Q: Write a function which takes two numbers and returns their sum.

Understanding the problem:
```js
// 1. Implement addition

// 2. This depends, are we talking about floating points exclusively? How large will these numbers be (some languages have an upper bound for the size of numbers and if we want to add really large numbers it doesn't work well)?
  // Also, are we only working with two inputs?

// 3. Similar to the second point's logic, should it be an integer? Float? If we pass in two floats do we want a float back? If we pass in an integer and a float, are we even allowed to pass in a float? Or string?

// 4. In most cases, yes. But what if someone only passes in one number? We wouldn't have enough information to do the addition at that point, so do we add zero? Do we return 'undefined' or 'null'? This would depend on the interviewer...

// 5. So what matters? We have the 'inputs' and the 'outputs' and that's pretty much all we need... Maybe we name our function 'add' and have 'numOne' and 'numTwo' as the arguments with 'sum' as the result that we return.
  // this is a very simply example but once we get into more complicated problems, thinking about this step by step can really make a difference.
```

#### Step 2: Explore concrete examples

Coming up with examples can help us understand the problem better. Examples also provide sanity checks that your eventual solution works as it should.

Examples of this could be __user stories__, which are basically, if given an _input_ what should the _output_ be? The input could be a _user action_ and what should happen after this _user action_?

Another example could be __unit tests__, which are used on a smaller scale to help layout how something should work for a smaller feature.

Let's now look at some steps we can take for exploring concrete examples:

  1. Start with _simple_ examples
  2. Progress to more _complex_ examples
  3. Explore examples with _empty inputs_
  4. Explore examples with _invalid inputs_

#### Step 2: Example:
Q: Write a function which takes in a string and returns counts of each character in the string.

Concrete examples:
```js
charCount('aaaa');
/*
  a: 4
*/
```
```js
charCount('hello');
/*
  h: 1,
  h: 1,
  h: 2,
  h: 1
*/
```
```js
charCount('Your PIN number is 1234');
/*
  1: 1,
  2: 1,
  3: 1,
  b: 1,
  e: 1,
  i: 2,
  m: 1,
  n: 2,
  o: 1,
  p: 1,
  r: 2,
  s: 1,
  u: 2,
  y: 1
*/
```

#### Step 3: Break it down

In other words take the actual steps of the problem and write them down. This doesn't mean full sudo code or valid syntax, it's little comments as a guide for the steps I'm going to need to take.

This forces us to think about our code before we write it, and it helps us catch any lingering conceptual issues or misunderstandings before we dive in and have to worry about details.

#### Step 3: Example:
Q: Write a function which takes in a string and returns counts of each character in the string.

Now that we have some good concrete examples from step 2, let's type out the skeleton (somewhat pseudo code) of our function:
```js
function charCount(str) {
  // 1. make object to return at the end
  // 2. loop over string, for each char
    // 2.1 if char is a number/letter AND is a key in object, add 1 to char count
    // 2.2 if char is a number/letter AND not in object, add char to object and set value to 1
    // 2.3 if char is something else (space, period, etc) don't do anything
	
  // 3. return object at the end
}
```

#### Step 4: Solve or simplify

So basically, SOLVE the problem if you can but if you can't SOLVE a simpler problem... This is where the "simplify" comes in.

What this means is, trying to ignore the part that is giving you a really hard time in order to focus on everything else. It's worth it to do this because in an interview setting, we want to have something to show for yourself.

#### The idea behind "Simplify":
  * Find the core difficulty in what your're trying to do
  * Temporarily ignore that difficulty
  * Write a simplified solution
  * Then incorporate that difficulty back in (by this step, we often gain insight into how to do this)

#### Step 4: Example:
Q: Write a function which takes in a string and returns counts of each character in the string.

Let's fill in the actual syntax for our pseudo code:
```js
function charCount(str) {
  // 1. create empty obj we will return at the end
  let obj = {};
  // 2. loop through all characters in string
  for (let char of str) {
    // 2.1 lowercase each character
    char = char.toLowerCase();
    // 2.2 check to be sure all characters are lowercase letters (a-z) or numbers (0-9) (regular expression)
    if (/[a-z0-9]/.test(char)) {
      // 2.2.1 check if the character is already in the object, meaning it's greater than 0 (it's set to 1 or 2 or 3 etc.)
      if (obj[char] > 0) {
        // if object character exists, add 1 to the character count
        obj[char]++;
      } else {
        // if object character does not exist, set object (initialize) character to 1
        obj[char] = 1;
      }
    }
  }
  // 3. return our object
  return obj;
}
charCount('hello'); // -> { h: 1, e: 1, l: 2, o: 1 }
```

#### Step 5: Look back and refactor

After we have solved our problem let's look at a checklist of questions we can ask ourselves:
  * Can you check the result?
  * Can you derive the result differently?
  * Can you understand it at a glance?
  * Can you use the result or method for some other problem?
  * Can you improve the performance of your solution?
  * Can you think of other ways to refactor?
  * How have other people solved this problem?

Let's refactor our previous code a bit:
```js
function charCount(str) {
  let obj = {};
  for (let char of str) {
    // call our alphaNumeric function
    if (isAlphaNumeric(char)) {
      char = char.toLowerCase();
      // here we can refactor with a `ternary operator` (condition ? expIfTrue : expIfFalse)
      obj[char] ? obj[char]++ : (obj[char] = 1);
    }
  }
  return obj;
}
console.log(charCount('Hello World hi!!!')); // { h: 2, e: 1, l: 3, o: 2, w: 1, r: 1, d: 1, i: 1 }

// create function to use above
function isAlphaNumeric(char) {
  // get the character code at index 0 (it's only one a character string so it's only index 0)
  let code = char.charCodeAt(0);

  if (
    !(code > 47 && code < 58) && // numeric (0-9)
    !(code > 64 && code < 91) && // upper alpha (A-Z)
    !(code > 96 && code < 123) // lower alpha (a-z)
  ) {
    return false;
  }
  return true;
}
```
