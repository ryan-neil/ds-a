When it comes to solving Data Structure & Algorithm questions, it's extremely important to understand the underlying patterns behind each question.

If you understand the generic patterns, you can use them as a template to solve a myriad of other problems with slight variations.

In this section we will lay out the _most common patterns_ that can be used to solve any coding interview question, as well as how to _identify_ each pattern.

## 1. Sliding Window

The Sliding Window pattern is used to perform a required operation on a specific window size of a given array or linked list, such as finding the longest sub-array containing all 1s. 

Sliding Windows start from the 1st element and keep shifting right by one element and adjust the length of the window according to the problem that you are solving. In some cases, the window size remains constant and in other cases the sizes grows or shrinks.

### Identification:
  * The problem input is a linear data structure such as a linked list, array, or string
  * You’re asked to find the longest/shortest substring, sub-array, or a desired value

### Common Problems:
  * Maximum sum sub-array of size ‘K’ (Easy)
  * Longest substring with ‘K’ distinct characters (Medium)
  * String anagrams (Hard)
